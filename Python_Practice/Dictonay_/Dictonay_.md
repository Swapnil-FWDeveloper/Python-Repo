# Python Data Structures and Operations

This repository contains examples of Python code demonstrating the use of dictionaries and sets, along with various operations and methods associated with them.

## Dictionary Operations

### Overview
Dictionaries are used to store data values in the form of key-value pairs. They are unordered, mutable, and do not allow duplicate keys.

### Examples
- `keys()`: Returns all keys in the dictionary.
- `values()`: Returns all values in the dictionary.
- `items()`: Returns all (key, value) pairs as tuples.
- `get()`: Returns the value for the specified key.
- `update()`: Updates the dictionary with specified items.

## Set Operations

### Overview
Sets are collections of unordered items where each element must be unique and immutable.

### Examples
- `add()`: Adds an element to the set.
- `remove()`: Removes the specified element from the set.
- `clear()`: Empties the set.
- `union()`: Combines two sets and returns a new set containing all unique elements.
- `intersection()`: Returns a new set containing common elements between two sets.

## Usage
You can run these code examples in any Python environment or IDE.
