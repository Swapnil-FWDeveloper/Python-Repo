Sure, here are some very short and informative notes for a README file about variables, rules for identifiers/variables, and data types:

---

## Variables

A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.

Example:
```python
name = "Swapnil"
```
Here, `name` is a variable with the value "Swapnil", representing a memory location holding the value "Swapnil".

## Rules for Identifiers / Variables

- Start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, * are not allowed at the start.
- Python keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

## Data Types

- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero.
- **String**: Represents text data, enclosed in double or single quotes.
- **Float**: Represents decimal numbers.
- **Boolean**: Represents True or False values.
- **None**: Represents the absence of a value.

Example:
```python
age = 25
name = "John"
height = 5.11
is_student = True
no_value = None
```

Keywords
Keywords are reserved words in python.
Ture False return break class while if else or import elif else and many more. 
rest please google it.

Types of Token
Punctuators
are the symbols to organize sentence structure in programming.
().{},@,[],#, etc.

Python is a implicit language
means here we dont have to tell python its type everytime
ex name="Swapnil" here we have not tell is type 


Explicit here we have to tell its type always like JAVA, C++


#Expression Execution 

#Rule 1
A,B=2,3
expExe="@"
print(A*expExe*B)
print(2*expExe*3)
#The code assigns `2` to `A`, `3` to `B`, `"@"` to `expExe`, then prints `"@@@"  as Python is Expression Execution language.

#Rule 2
# String & Sting can operate with +
a,b="2",3
expExe1="@"
print((a+expExe1)*b)
# The code assigns the string `"2"` to `a`, `3` to `b`, `"@"` to `expExe1`, then prints `"@@@".

# Rule 3
# Numeric value can operate with all the operator
c,d=2,3
e=4
print(c+d*e)
