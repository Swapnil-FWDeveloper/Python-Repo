Sure, here are some very short and informative notes for a README file about variables, rules for identifiers/variables, and data types:

---

## Variables

A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.

Example:
```python
name = "Swapnil"
```
Here, `name` is a variable with the value "Swapnil", representing a memory location holding the value "Swapnil".

## Rules for Identifiers / Variables

- Start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_).
- Subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0-9), or underscores.
- Special characters like !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, * are not allowed at the start.
- Python keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

## Data Types

- **Integer**: Represents whole numbers, positive, negative, or zero.
- **String**: Represents text data, enclosed in double or single quotes.
- **Float**: Represents decimal numbers.
- **Boolean**: Represents True or False values.
- **None**: Represents the absence of a value.

Example:
```python
age = 25
name = "John"
height = 5.11
is_student = True
no_value = None
```
