# Python Data Structures Practice

This repository contains Python code snippets demonstrating the usage of lists and tuples in Python. Below are explanations of the code snippets included in this repository:

## Lists and Tuples

- **Lists**:
    - Lists are built-in data structures in Python that store a set of values.
    - They are mutable, meaning elements can be changed after creation.
    - Lists can store elements of different types, such as integers, floats, strings, etc.

- **Tuples**:
    - Tuples are built-in data structures in Python that create immutable sequences of values.
    - They are defined using parentheses ().
    - Elements in tuples cannot be changed after creation.

## Code Snippets

1. **Tuple Method Example**:
    - Demonstrates the usage of tuple methods such as `index()` and `count()`.

2. **Asking User for Favorite Movies**:
    - Prompts the user to enter their three favorite movie names and stores them in a list.

3. **Check if a List Contains a Palindrome**:
    - Allows the user to check if a string is a palindrome.

4. **Count the Number of Students with Grade "A"**:
    - Counts the number of students with the grade "A" in a list of grades.

5. **Sorting and Printing the List**:
    - Sorts and prints a list of grades in ascending order.

## How to Use

- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Open the Python files using a Python interpreter or an IDE.
- Run the code snippets to see their outputs.

## Try Different Things

- Modify the values in the code snippets to see how they affect the output.
- Try adding new elements or changing the order of elements in lists.
- Experiment with different strings to check if they are palindromes.
